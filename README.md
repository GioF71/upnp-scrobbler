# UPnP Scrobbler

A simple LAST.fm scrobbler for WiiM devices.  
It can now also scrobble to a subsonic server.  

## References

I started taking the code published in [this post](https://forum.wiimhome.com/threads/last-fm.3144/post-44653) as the starting point.  
It seems that I cannot get a valid link to the user profile on that board, but anyway the nickname is `cc_rider`.  
A big thank you goes to him/her for the code he/she shared.  
I then used [pylast](https://github.com/pylast/pylast), as suggested in that thread, for the actual operations on [last.fm](https://www.last.fm/).  
I also use [subsonic-connector](https://github.com/GioF71/subsonic-connector) for subsonic scrobbling.

## Task List

- [x] Scrobbling to last.fm from a WiiM device, using Tidal Connect
- [x] Scrobbling to last.fm from a WiiM device, using it as a generic UPnP Renderer
- [x] Scrobbling to last.fm from gmrender-resurrect ([Source](https://github.com/hzeller/gmrender-resurrect) and [Docker image](https://github.com/gioF71/gmrender-resurrect-docker)), using it as a generic UPnP Renderer

## Build

You can build the docker image by typing:

```text
docker build . -t giof71/upnp-scrobbler
```

## Configuration

### Create your API key and secret

Open your browser at [this](https://www.last.fm/api/account/create), follow the instruction and accurately store the generated values.  
Those will be needed for the configuration.

### Environment Variables

NAME|DESCRIPTION
:---|:---
DEVICE_URL|Device URL of your UPnP Device, alternative to DEVICE_UDN and DEVICE_NAME (example: `http://192.168.1.7:49152/description.xml`)
DEVICE_UDN|Device identifier, alternative to DEVICE_URL and DEVICE_NAME (must match only one device)
DEVICE_NAME|Device friendly name, alternative to DEVICE_URL and DEVICE_UDN (must match only one device)
DEVICE_TIMEOUT_SEC_INITIAL|Int value, defaults to `5` seconds
DEVICE_TIMEOUT_SEC_DELTA|Int value, defaults to `5` seconds
DEVICE_TIMEOUT_SEC_MAX|Int value, defaults to `60` seconds
LAST_FM_API_KEY|Your LAST.fm api key, mandatory
LAST_FM_SHARED_SECRET|Your LAST.fm api key, mandatory
LAST_FM_USERNAME|Your LAST.fm account username, optional
LAST_FM_PASSWORD_HASH|Your LAST.fm account password encoded using md5, optional
LAST_FM_PASSWORD|Your LAST.fm account password in clear text, optional, used when LAST_FM_PASSWORD_HASH is not provided
ENABLE_NOW_PLAYING|Update `now playing` information if set to `yes` (default)
DURATION_THRESHOLD|Minimum duration required from scrobbling (unless at least half of the duration has elapsed), defaults to `240`
DUMP_UPNP_DATA|Additional logging for UPnP data, defaults to `no`
DUMP_EVENT_KEYS|Dump keys from each event keys, defaults to `no`
DUMP_EVENT_KEY_VALUES|Dump data from each event keys, defaults to `no`

## Running

The preferred way of running this application is through Docker.  

### Configuration directory

When using docker, the base configuration directory is `/config`. When running outside of docker, the code looks for the default config directory using the [`platformdirs`](https://github.com/tox-dev/platformdirs) library.  

#### LAST.fm configuration file

LAST.FM related variables can be stored in a file inside the `<config-directory>` volume, exacly at `<config-directory>/upnp-scrobbler/last.fm/last_fm_config.env`. Example:  

```text
LAST_FM_API_KEY=xxxx
LAST_FM_SHARED_SECRET=xxxx
# optional
LAST_FM_USERNAME=xxxx
# optional
LAST_FM_PASSWORD=xxxx
# optional
LAST_FM_PASSWORD_HASH=xxxx
```

#### Subsonic Configuration files

Subsonic related variables should be save in files inside the `<config-directory>` volume, exacly at `<config-directory>/upnp-scrobbler/subsonic/subsonic.server.env`, and optionally `<config-directory>/upnp-scrobbler/subsonic/subsonic.credentials.env` (if you want to separate credentials). Example for both files:  

```text
SUBSONIC_BASE_URL=https://your-subsonic-server.your-domain.com
# legacy auth
SUBSONIC_LEGACY_AUTH=true
# there is an alias available for variable name SUBSONIC_LEGACYAUTH (it's named this way in upmpdcli)
# SUBSONIC_LEGACYAUTH=true
# optional port, by default it will be `443` if the base url starts with `https`, otherwise `80`
SUBSONIC_PORT=443
# optional server path
# SUBSONIC_SERVER_PATH=server-path
```

and:

```text
SUBSONIC_USERNAME=your-username
# there is an alias available for variable name SUBSONIC_USER (it's named this way in upmpdcli)
# SUBSONIC_USER=your-username
SUBSONIC_PASSWORD=your-password
```

You can collapse all the variables in one file, but its name must be `subsonic.server.env`.  

### LAST.fm authentication

If username and password (hash or plaintext) is not provided, the application will prompt you to authorize the app.  
You will need to watch the logs, al least for the first run.  
Please note that API key and secret are still required.  

### Sample compose file

Here is a simple compose file, valid for a WiiM device:

```text
---
version: "3"

services:
  scrobbler:
    image: giof71/upnp-scrobbler:latest
    container_name: wiim-scrobbler
    network_mode: host
    environment:
      - DEVICE_URL=http://192.168.1.7:49152/description.xml
      - LAST_FM_API_KEY=your-lastfm-api-key
      - LAST_FM_SHARED_SECRET=your-lastfm-api-secret
      - LAST_FM_USERNAME=your-lastfm-username
      - LAST_FM_PASSWORD_HASH=your-lastfm-md5-hashed-password
    restart: unless-stopped
```

It is advisable to put the variable values in a .env file in the same directory with this `docker-compose.yaml` file.  
Start the container with the following:

`docker-compose up -d`
